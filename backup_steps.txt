1)open new terminal run docker exec -it postgres bash

2)run su postgres

3)run pg_basebackup -D /backup/standalone-"$(date +%Y-%m-%dT%H-%M)" -c fast -P -R 

4)copy postgresql.conf in miniproject folder and replace it with postgresql.conf file in directory miniproject/db_data

5)in miniproject folder open a terminal run docker compose down then again run  docker compose up

6) run steps 1 and 2 again

7)run createdb sample

8)run pgbench -i -s 10 sample

9)if you check miniproject/archive you can see wal files are saving now

10)open new terminal in miniproject folder and run docker compose down

11)go to miniproject/db_data delete all the files and folders inside db_data folder

12)copy all files and folders from miniproject/backup/standalone-<timestamp of your base backup> directory to miniproject/db_data

13)rename standby.signal to recovery.signal

14) run step 4 again

15) open new terminal in miniproject folder and run docker compose up

16)run stap 1 and 2 again then run psql
then run \l you must see sample db 
run \c sample 
run select count(*) from pgbench_accounts;
you must see 1000000 as output and we recovered all out data back

Thanks for following my solution until here I really appreciate it :))))
